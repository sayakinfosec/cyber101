## Public Key Cryptography Basics

### ðŸ’Ž Introduction

* **Symmetric (Private Key) Crypto** â†’ fast, mainly for **confidentiality**.
* **Asymmetric (Public Key) Crypto** â†’ slower, but supports **authentication, authenticity, integrity**.
* Use asymmetric to exchange keys, then switch to symmetric for speed.

ðŸ‘‰ Covered systems: **RSA, Diffie-Hellman, SSH, SSL/TLS Certificates, PGP/GPG**.

### ðŸ’Ž Key Exchange Analogy

* **Secret code** = symmetric cipher + key
* **Lock** = public key
* **Key to lock** = private key

We use public keys once (for key exchange), then switch to faster symmetric encryption.

### ðŸ’Ž RSA (Rivestâ€“Shamirâ€“Adleman)

* Based on the difficulty of **factoring large numbers**.
* **Easy** â†’ multiply two primes.
* **Hard** â†’ reverse factorization.

**RSA Workflow:**

* **p, q** â†’ two **large prime numbers** (secret, chosen at random).
* **n** = p Ã— q â†’ the **modulus**, part of the **public key**.
* **Ï•(n)** = (pâˆ’1)(qâˆ’1) â†’ Eulerâ€™s totient, used to calculate the private key.
* **e** â†’ the **public exponent**, usually a small number like 65537. It must be coprime with Ï•(n).
* **d** â†’ the **private exponent**, calculated as the modular inverse of e mod Ï•(n).
* **(n, e)** â†’ the **public key** (everyone can see this).
* **(n, d)** â†’ the **private key** (kept secret).
* **m** â†’ the plaintext message (as a number).
* **c** â†’ the ciphertext (encrypted message).

ðŸ‘‰ **Encryption**:
c = m^e mod n

ðŸ‘‰ **Decryption**:
m = c^d mod n

So in short:

* p, q = secret primes
* n = modulus
* e = public exponent
* d = private exponent
* m = message
* c = ciphertext

âœ… Example (simplified):

* p = 157, q = 199 â†’ n = 31243, Ï•(n) = 30888
* e = 163, d = 379
* Encrypt x=13 â†’ y = 13^163 mod 31243 = 16341
* Decrypt y=16341 â†’ x = 16341^379 mod 31243 = 13

**In CTFs**: know terms â†’ p, q, n, e, d, m, c.  Tools: **RsaCtfTool, rsatool**.

### ðŸ’Ž Diffieâ€“Hellman (DH) Key Exchange

* Purpose: establish **shared secret** over insecure channel.
* Publicly agree on `p` (prime) and `g` (generator).
* Alice: pick private `a`, compute A = g^a mod p.
* Bob: pick private `b`, compute B = g^b mod p.
* Exchange A, B.
* Alice computes Key = B^a mod p, Bob computes Key = A^b mod p â†’ both equal g^(ab) mod p.

âœ… Example: p=29, g=5, a=12, b=17

* A = 5^12 mod 29 = 7
* B = 5^17 mod 29 = 9
* Shared key: 9^12 mod 29 = 7^17 mod 29 = 24

---

### ðŸ’Ž SSH (Secure Shell)

* **Server authentication**: confirm serverâ€™s public key fingerprint.
* **Client authentication**: username+password OR key-based auth (recommended).
* **Key generation**: `ssh-keygen -t rsa | ed25519 | ecdsa ...`
* Private keys = like passwords â†’ never share.
* Passphrase protects private key (locally, never sent).
* Public key goes into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on server.

ðŸ‘‰ In CTFs: can use SSH keys as backdoors for persistent access.

---

### ðŸ’Ž Digital Signatures & Certificates

* **Digital Signature** = prove authenticity + integrity.

  * Private key signs â†’ Public key verifies.
  * Signature = encrypted hash of document.
* **Certificates** = prove identity via chain of trust.

  * Root CA â†’ Intermediate CA â†’ Website cert.
  * Example: HTTPS relies on TLS certificates.
* Free TLS certificates: **Letâ€™s Encrypt**.

---

### ðŸ’Ž PGP & GPG

* **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)** â†’ software for encryption/signing.
* **GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)** â†’ open-source implementation of OpenPGP standard.
* Used in **emails, file encryption, digital signatures**.

**Workflow:**

1. Generate key pair: `gpg --full-gen-key`
2. Share **public key**.
3. Others encrypt with your public key â†’ you decrypt with private key.
4. Private keys can be protected with passphrases.

Use GPG to decrypt the message in ~/Public-Crypto-Basics/Task-7. What secret word does the message hold?

```
user@ip-10-201-65-12:~/Public-Crypto-Basics/Task-7$ ls
message.gpg tryhackme.key
user@ip-10-201-65-12:~/Public-Crypto-Basics/Task-7$ gpg --import tryhackme.key
