# Cyber 101 Journey 🚀  

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through **Cyber Security 101** on TryHackMe 🔥

It covers structured progress across **offensive** and **defensive** security concepts, including networking, Linux, Windows, Active Directory, exploitation, web hacking, digital forensics, and SOC operations.

The repo acts as my personal knowledge base and portfolio - with detailed notes, commands, tools, and observations from each lab.
