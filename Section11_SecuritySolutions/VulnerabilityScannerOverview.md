## Vulnerability Scanner Overview

### What Are Vulnerabilities?
Imagine you are living in a small, lovely house. One day, you notice that your roof has many small holes. If not treated, these small holes can cause significant problems. During rain, water can come through these leaks and damage your furniture. Dust particles and insects can enter the house through these tiny holes. These small holes are a weakness in your home that can lead to significant problems in the future if not addressed timely. These weaknesses are known as vulnerabilities. You start repairing the roof to fix this problem and keep your home safe. This process of fixing the vulnerabilities is known as **Patching**.

Digital devices also have vulnerabilities inside their software or hardware. These are weaknesses in the software programs or hardware that an attacker can leverage to compromise the digital device. These vulnerabilities may sound normal, like the small holes in the roof of a house that can be repaired anytime. However, the vulnerabilities in digital devices can lead to massive damage if not noticed on time. Hackers are always searching for these weaknesses as they make their way to your systems or networks by exploiting them.

The interesting thing about digital device vulnerabilities is that you cannot notice them as easily as the holes in the roof until you dedicate yourself to hunting them down. After hunting these vulnerabilities down, the process of patching starts, where fixes are applied to protect the vulnerabilities.

This room is about learning how to hunt these vulnerabilities in digital devices. We will study some of the available tools to automate this hunting and leverage one of the tools to demonstrate how it’s done practically.

### Vulnerability Scanning
Vulnerability scanning is the inspection of digital systems to find weaknesses. Organizations carry critical information in their digital infrastructure and must regularly scan their systems and networks for vulnerabilities, as attackers can leverage these weaknesses to compromise their digital infrastructure. 

Vulnerability scanning is also an important compliance requirement of many regulatory bodies. Some standards recommend quarterly scans, while others suggest annual scans.

Manual scanning can be slow and inefficient for large networks. Automated vulnerability scanners solve this issue by quickly checking systems and producing easy-to-read reports of discovered vulnerabilities.

After identifying vulnerabilities, organizations fix them through patches—changes made to software or systems to remove the weakness.

### Types of Vulnerability Scans

#### Authenticated vs Unauthenticated Scans
| Authenticated Scans | Unauthenticated Scans |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Requires credentials of the host. | Does not require host credentials. |
| Identifies vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers with access. | Identifies vulnerabilities exploitable from outside. |
| Provides deeper visibility into configurations and applications. | Less resource-intensive and easy to set up. |
| Example: Scanning an internal database with credentials. | Example: Scanning a public-facing website. |

**Answer:**  
- Authenticated scans require the credentials of the target host.  
- External scans focus on vulnerabilities exploitable from outside the network.

#### Internal vs External Scans
| Internal Scans | External Scans |
|----------------|----------------|
| Conducted from inside the network. | Conducted from outside the network. |
| Focus on vulnerabilities exploitable within the network. | Focus on vulnerabilities exploitable from outside the network. |
| Identify vulnerabilities exposed to attackers after gaining internal access. | Identify vulnerabilities visible to external attackers. |

The choice of scan type depends on scope and purpose. Authenticated scans are often internal; unauthenticated scans are often external.

### Tools for Vulnerability Scanning
There are many automated vulnerability scanning tools available. Some of the most popular are:

#### Nessus
Developed as an open-source project in 1998 and acquired by Tenable in 2005. It is now proprietary. Nessus offers both free and paid versions, with the paid version including advanced features, unlimited scans, and professional support. It requires on-premises deployment.

#### Qualys
A subscription-based cloud vulnerability management solution launched in 1999. Qualys provides continuous vulnerability scanning, compliance checks, and asset management. Being cloud-based, it requires no physical deployment or maintenance.

#### Nexpose
Developed by Rapid7 in 2005, Nexpose continuously discovers assets in the network and performs vulnerability scans. It assigns risk scores based on asset value and impact, supports compliance checks, and offers both on-premises and hybrid deployment.

#### OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System)
Developed by Greenbone Security, OpenVAS is a free, open-source solution suitable for smaller organizations. It scans for known vulnerabilities and includes basic reporting features. We will explore OpenVAS further in the next section.

All scanners generate reports containing details, severity scores, and sometimes remediation advice.

**Answers:**
- Is Nessus currently open-source? **Nay**  
- Company that developed Nexpose? **Rapid7**  
- Open-source vulnerability scanner by Greenbone Security? **OpenVAS**

### CVE and CVSS

#### CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
CVE assigns unique identification numbers to publicly known vulnerabilities, managed by the **MITRE Corporation**. Each CVE entry includes:
- **CVE prefix**
- **Year of discovery**
- **Arbitrary digits (unique ID)**

Example: CVE-2024-9374

CVE identifiers make it easier to reference, track, and remediate vulnerabilities globally.

#### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
CVSS provides a score (0.0 - 10.0) representing the severity of a vulnerability. This helps prioritize remediation efforts.

| CVSS Score Range | Severity Level |
|------------------|----------------|
| 0.0 - 3.9 | Low |
| 4.0 - 6.9 | Medium |
| 7.0 - 8.9 | High |
| 9.0 - 10 | Critical |

**Answers:**
- CVE stands for **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures**  
- Developed by **MITRE Corporation**  
- CVSS score 5.3 = **Medium**

### OpenVAS

OpenVAS is a complete open-source vulnerability scanner. It can be installed on Ubuntu using Docker to simplify dependencies.

#### Installation
```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo docker run -d -p 443:443 --name openvas immauss/openvas
````

Access the OpenVAS web interface at:

```
https://127.0.0.1
```

#### Performing a Scan

1. Open OpenVAS dashboard and navigate to **Scans → Tasks**.
2. Create a new task and define scan targets (IP or network).
3. Choose scan options and start the scan.
4. After completion, review results and export reports.

**Answers:**

* IP of scanned machine: **10.10.154.44**
* Number of vulnerabilities found: **13**

### Practical Exercise

**Scenario:**
A firm scanned its server (10.201.29.84) using OpenVAS to strengthen its security posture. You are tasked to analyze the vulnerability scan report located on the desktop or rerun the scan.

To start OpenVAS (if rerunning the scan):

```bash
docker start openvas
```

Access OpenVAS:

```
https://127.0.0.1/login/login.html
```

**Credentials:**

* Username: admin
* Password: admin

**Answers:**

* Score of the high-severity vulnerability: **10**
* Suggested solution: **Change the password of the mentioned account(s)**
