## Search Skills  

### 🎯 Objective  
Learn to efficiently search the Internet and use specialized search engines and technical documentation.  

### ❓ Questions Encountered  
- What do you call a cryptographic method or product considered bogus or fraudulent?  
  - **Snake Oil**  
- What is the name of the command replacing `netstat` in Linux systems?  
  - **ss (socket statistics)**  
- How would you limit your Google search to PDF files containing the terms cyber warfare report?  
  - Use: `cyber warfare report filetype:pdf`  
- What phrase does the Linux command `ss` stand for?  
  - **Socket Statistics**  

### 🔎 Specialized Search Engines  
- **Shodan** → Search engine for devices connected to the Internet (servers, routers, IoT, ICS). Example: `apache 2.4.1`.  
- **Censys** → Focuses on Internet-connected hosts, websites, certificates, and assets. Used for domain enumeration, auditing open ports/services, and rogue asset discovery.  
- **VirusTotal** → Scans files/URLs against multiple AV engines. Can also input file hashes. Example finding: `Android.Riskware.Agent.LHH`.  
- **Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)** → Checks if an email has appeared in a data breach.  

**Practice Qs:**  
- What is the top country with lighttpd servers? → **United States**  
- What does BitDefenderFalx detect the file with the hash `2de70ca737c1f4602517c555ddd54165432cf231ffc0e21fb2e23b9dd14e7fb4` as?  
  - **Android.Riskware.Agent.LHH**  

### 🛡️ Vulnerabilities & Exploits  
- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** → Public dictionary of vulnerabilities.  
- **Exploit Database** → Resource listing exploit codes (some verified).  
- **GitHub** → Contains tools, PoCs, and exploit code (e.g., Heartbleed exploit repos).  

### 📘 Technical Documentation  
- **Linux** → `man` command (manual pages). Example: `man ip`.  
- **Windows** → Microsoft official technical docs: [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/)  

**Practice Qs:**  
- What does the Linux command `cat` stand for?  
  - **Concatenate**  
- What is the `netstat` parameter in MS Windows that displays the executable associated with each active connection and listening port?  
  - **`-b`**
